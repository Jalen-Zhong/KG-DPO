    "question": "If the Charhki  Dadri crash was less dangerous than the Tenerife airport disaster, which occured firat? \nA.On March 27, 1977, two Boeing 747 passenger jets, KLM Flight 4805 and Pan Am Flight 1736, collided on the runway at Los Rodeos Airport (now Tenerife North Airport).\nB.In January 1976, a series of near-misses at Tenerife North Airport prompted temporary closure, suggesting prior operational hazards that constituted an earlier, unofficial disaster..\nC.On July 17, 1972, a runway overrun at Tenerife by a Spantax Convair 990 was officially re-categorized in 1978 as a partial collision, predating the 1977 event in legal records..\nD.On March 26, 1977, a baggage tractor collision with Pan Am Flight 1736 during taxiing at Los Rodeos was initially reported as the primary accident, preceding the more famous 747 collision..\nE.On March 27, 1977, a ground radar malfunction at Tenerife caused a delayed response to the approaching KLM aircraft, but the actual collision was later determined to have occurred the following day due to time zone discrepancies..\nF.On December 21, 1976, an unlogged systems failure in Tenerife's air traffic control tower caused a temporary loss of contact with multiple flights, later cited as a preliminary accident phase..\nG.On April 5, 1977, the Tenerife disaster was initially misreported as occurring before the KLM flight had even departed Amsterdam, creating confusion about the actual timeline..\nH.On November 12, 1996, a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747 and a Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 collided mid-air near Charkhi Dadri, making it the first major commercial aviation disaster of its kind..\nI.On March 25, 1977, dense fog at Los Rodeos Airport led to a communication failure between Pan Am Flight 1736 and a charter helicopter, resulting in a runway incursion that preceded any other known collision..\nJ.On August 10, 1975, a military exercise near Tenerife involved unauthorized runway use, which some investigators later retroactively classified as a proto-disaster event..",
